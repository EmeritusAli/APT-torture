# Global Torture Prevention Progress

This project visualizes global progress in the adoption and implementation of key legal benchmarks for preventing torture, based on data provided by the *Association for the Prevention of Torture (APT)*. The visualization allows users to explore how countries have performed against eight legal indicators over time.

## Methodology
The data used in this visualization was provided by the **Association for the Prevention of Torture (APT)**. It includes eight indicators identified as legal benchmarks for measuring progress in torture prevention across countries. Each indicator focuses on legal frameworks rather than practical implementation, as these are easier to document consistently. These indicators represent whether a country has met specific legal obligations or milestones, providing a foundation for understanding progress toward eradicating torture. For each country, the data records whether the indicator has been *implemented ("Yes")*, partially implemented *("Partially")*, or not *implemented ("No")*.

### Live Project
The visualization is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed here: [APT Torture Prevention Visualization](https://emeritusali.github.io/APT-torture/)
